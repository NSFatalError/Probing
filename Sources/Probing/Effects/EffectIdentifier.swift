/// A unique identifier of an effect at every point in its execution.
///
/// An `EffectIdentifier` consists of the ``EffectName`` components passed to the ``Effect(_:preprocessorFlag:priority:operation:)``
/// macro (and its variants). These names form the identifier's ``path``, which reflects the stack of nested effects during a particular invocation.
///
/// The identifier is represented as a string formed by concatenating these components with `"."` separators:
/// ```swift
/// path.map(\.rawValue).joined(separator: ".")
/// // "effect1.effect2.(...).effectN"
/// ```
///
/// If the ``path`` is empty, the identifier is also empty, and the effect is known as the ``root``.
/// The root effect is the one that executes the `body` of the `ProbeTesting.withProbing` function, and it is created implicitly.
/// All effects created within `body` are considered descendants of the root effect.
/// ```swift
/// withProbing {
///     // #Effect(.root) {
///     try await body()
///     // }
/// } dispatchedBy: { ... }
/// ```
///
/// ### Example
///
/// ```swift
/// func createInnerEffect() {
///     #Effect("inner") {}
/// }
///
/// func createOuterEffect() {
///     #Effect("outer") {
///         createInnerEffect()
///     }
/// }
///
/// createInnerEffect()
/// // Identifier: "inner"
///
/// createOuterEffect()
/// // Identifiers: "outer", "outer.inner"
/// ```
