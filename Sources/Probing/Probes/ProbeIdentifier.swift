/// A unique identifier of a probe at a specific point in execution.
///
/// A `ProbeIdentifier` consists of the ``effect`` identifier in which the probe was installed during a particular test run,
/// and the probe ``name`` passed to the ``probe(_:preprocessorFlag:)`` macro.
///
/// It is represented as a string formed by concatenating these components with `"."` separators:
/// ```swift
/// "\(effect).\(name)"
/// // "effect1.effect2.(...).effectN.probe"
/// ```
///
/// If the probe is installed directly in the `body` of the `ProbeTesting.withProbing` function, without any intermediate effects,
/// the identifier contains only the ``name``, since the ``effect``.``EffectIdentifier/path`` is empty:
/// ```swift
/// "\(name)"
