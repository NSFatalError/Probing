/// Object that controls execution of the `body` during a test.
///
/// You don't create instances of `ProbingDispatcher` directly.
/// Instead, an instance is provided to you within the `test` closure of ``withProbing(options:sourceLocation:isolation:of:dispatchedBy:)``.
///
/// `ProbingDispatcher` always performs the minimal necessary work to drive execution toward a desired state.
/// After calling one of its methods, it eagerly suspends the `body` and any effects it created by its invocation at two points:
/// - Explicitly, at declared `#probe()` macros within the `body` and nested effects
/// - Implicitly, immediately after initializing effects with `#Effect` macros, preventing them from starting until required
///
/// This ensures that no part of the tested code runs concurrently with the expectations defined in the `test`,
/// as long as your code uses `#Effect` macros instead of the `Task` APIs.
///
/// - SeeAlso: For details on how probe and effect identifiers are constructed, see the `Probing` documentation.
