# ``ProbeTesting``

Control the execution of asynchronous code during tests using a sequence of dispatches.

## Overview

To use `ProbeTesting`, you first need to prepare your codebase using the `Probing` library.

- SeeAlso: Refer to the `Probing` documentation for details on how to make your code controllable during tests.

`ProbeTesting` gives you precise control over the execution of asynchronous code,  
making it fully predictable and testable. It also lets you reason about the flow 
from the userâ€™s perspective by reducing it to a clear, step-by-step sequence of dispatches.

To use these features, wrap your test code with the 
``withProbing(options:sourceLocation:isolation:of:dispatchedBy:)`` function:

```swift
@Test
func testLoading() async throws {
    try await withProbing {
        await viewModel.load()
    } dispatchedBy: { dispatcher in
        #expect(viewModel.isLoading == false)
        #expect(viewModel.download == nil)

        try await dispatcher.runUpToProbe()
        #expect(viewModel.isLoading == true)
        #expect(viewModel.download == nil)

        downloaderMock.shouldFailDownload = false
        try await dispatcher.runUntilExitOfBody()
        #expect(viewModel.isLoading == false)
        #expect(viewModel.download != nil)

        #expect(viewModel.prefetchedData == nil)
        try await dispatcher.runUntilEffectCompleted("backgroundFetch")
        #expect(viewModel.prefetchedData != nil)
    }
}
```
